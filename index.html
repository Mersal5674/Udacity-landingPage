                                    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
                                    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

                                    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
                                    The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks

                                    To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
                                    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
                                    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
                                    Must give us pause: there's the respect
                                    That makes calamity of so long life;
                                    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
                                    The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,

                                    That patient merit of the unworthy takes,

                                    The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
                                    No traveller returns, puzzles the will
                                    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
                                    Than fly to others that we know not of?
                                    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
                                    And thus the native hue of resolution
                                    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
                                    And enterprises of great pith and moment
                                    With this regard their currents turn awry,

                                    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
                                    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
                                    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
                                    And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
                                    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
                                    The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
                                    That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
                                    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
                                    To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
                                    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
                                    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
                                    Must give us pause: there's the respect
                                    That makes calamity of so long life;
                                    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
                                    The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
                                    The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
                                    The insolence of office and the spurns
                                    That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
                                    When he himself might his quietus make
                                    With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
                                    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
                                    But that the dread of something after death,
                                    The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
                                    No traveller returns, puzzles the will
                                    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
                                    Than fly to others that we know not of?
                                    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
                                    And thus the native hue of resolution
                                    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
                                    And enterprises of great pith and moment
                                    With this regard their currents turn awry,
                                    And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
                                    The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
                                    Be all my sins remember'd!”
